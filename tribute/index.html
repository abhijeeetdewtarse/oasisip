                <li>Khan was born in Tonk, Rajasthan into a Muslim family of Pathani ancestry.Khan's mother, <em>Saeeda
                        Begum</em> Khan was from Tonk, and his father, <em>Yaseen Ali</em> Khan, was from the Khajuriya
                    village in Rajasthan's Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business.</li><br>
                <li>He was good at cricket and was selected to play in the CK Nayudu Trophy for emerging players in the
                    under-23 category, a tournament seen as a stepping stone to first-class cricket in India.</li><br>
                <li>
                    He showed interest in acting under the influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre
                    artist in Jodhpur.In Jaipur, Khan asintroduced to noted theatre artists and did several stage
                    performances in the city. Khan completedhis MA in Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama
                    (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984 to study acting.</li>
                <li>
                    In his early days in Mumbai, he took up a job as an air conditioner repairman and visited the home
                    of his acting inspiration, Rajesh Khanna, in 1984.[30] Later in an interview Irfan stated, "The kind
                    of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the
                    most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your
                    idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality."
